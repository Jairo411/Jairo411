# Hi I am Jairo Alberto Morelli Santamaria 

### About me 

I'm a 2022 graduate from Humber College's game programming advance diploma program. In my studies, I learned many aspects of video game development / design. I enjoyed 
many aspects of my studies, I was most interested in the physics and graphics class I took while I was there. I believe these classes 
really enhanced my ability as a critcal thinker and problem solver, which I believe is the most important trait/aspect of a software developer. 

My interest as a developer range largely, from low level concepts like understanding how compilers work. Having Interest in the tools we use to build the world's 
tech products, the build tools we use like C-Make for C++ Developers or Maven and gradle for Java Developers. The languages we use, my favourite being Java, C++ and Kotlin in that order. To more theorical and abstract things, like what design pattern should I implement in a certain case? As well as what type of logic?(usually some sort of mathematics) Can I use to get this working without hard coding it? 

I am just interested in software development in general as a whole.

### My Journey So Far

My journey as a developer has been a interesting one so far, and I'm really exicted to continue to see what happens next! 
To give a short recap of my story, during my school days I tried to build my own 2D game engine as I felt that my skills were falling behind in 
relation to work I was doing in school, I still haven't managed to complete this game engine to this day, but the work I have put into my game engine gave me 
a tremendous amount of knowledge on how software applications are made at pretty low levels, as well as specific technical things, like 3D graphics APIs,
coding for a specific platform, in my case trying to actually have my game engine run on the windows platform, etc. 

I'm, fascinated in software development as a whole, and would consider the area I'm interested in the most is just the logic of getting things created and working.

As of right now, I've decided to switch my focus on working on my game engine, to learning how to be a fullstack developer through the Odin Projects free online course curiculum, 
with my main focus learning javascript, css and html. 

I am currently looking to work as a backend developer in javascript, with aspirations to become a fullstack developer in the near future, if you're interested in what I can offer please contact me!
