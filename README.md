# Hi I am Jairo Alberto Morelli Santamaria 

### About me 

I'm a 2022 graduate from Humber College's Game Programming Advance Diploma Program. In my studies, I learned many aspects of video game development / design. I enjoyed 
many aspects of my studies, I was most interested in the physics and 3D computer graphics class I took while I was there. I believe these classes 
really enhanced my ability as a critcal thinker and problem solver, which I believe are the most important traits/aspects of being a software developer. 

My interest as a developer range from understanding how compilers work, to the tools we use to build the world's 
tech products like C-Make for C++ developers or Maven and Gradle for Java developers and the programming languages we use to build software. My favourite languages are Java, C++ and Kotlin in that order.  


### My Journey So Far

My journey as a developer has been an interesting one so far, and I'm really exicted to continue seeing what will happen next! 
To give a short recap of my story, during my school days, I tried to build my own 2D game engine as I felt that my skills were falling behind in 
relation to work I was doing in school. To this day, I am committed to finishing this project. If you're interested I have a repository of my game engine which you can check out. I want to highlight that this has been a continous learning process for me; Through my efforts, I've gained foundational knowledge on how software applications are made, including 3D graphics APIs, coding for a specific platforms, using best coding practices to prevent unnecessary future technical debt.  

I'm fascinated with software development as a whole. I just like getting things up and working. 

As of right now, I am certain that I can be part of a team in a capacity as a front-end developer. I gained these skills through my continous self-directed and structured learning process. My future career goal is to become a fullstack developer. 

I am currently looking for an opportunity to contribute as a front-end developer mainly using, Javascript, NodeJs and React Native.
