# Hi I am Jairo Alberto Morelli Santamaria Software Developer

### About me 

I'm a graduate from Humber College's Game Programming Advance Diploma Program. In my studies, I learned many aspects of video game development / design. I enjoyed 
many aspects of my studies, but I was most interested in the multiple physics and 3D computer graphics class I took while I was there. I believe these classes 
really enhanced my ability as a critcal thinker and problem solver, which I believe are the most important traits/aspects of being a software developer. 

Areas of interest and or things worked on, 
3D graphics APIs (OpenGL), serialization APIs(tinyXML), Win32 API, Java, C\C++, Javascript(ECMAscript), SDL2, Webpack, etc. 

As you can see I have various areas of interest and focus. I believe that diversifying my knowledge as a software developer will give me compound gains, 
in the future. Even though I remain completely dedicated to working with Web technologies, I will still be slightly invested in other areas of software developement 
and tech in general.

If you wish to contact me, my information is below.
